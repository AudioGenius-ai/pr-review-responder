# Requirements

This document captures the requirements for the **pr-review-responder** CLI tool. The goal is to run on a schedule, check for new GitHub comments, and delegate processing to a Docker container running Codex.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Comment Retrieval**
   - Periodically poll GitHub for new comments on pull requests or issues.
   - The polling interval must be configurable via the CLI.
2. **Task Scheduling**
   - Use a cron-like scheduler to trigger the comment retrieval at the specified interval.
3. **Docker Delegation**
   - Forward each retrieved comment to a running Codex container using the Docker API.
   - Capture and log any output from Codex for debugging purposes.
4. **CLI Interface**
   - Provide a command-line entry point allowing users to start the scheduled task.
   - Support flags for customizing the schedule and Docker container settings.

## Nonâ€‘Functional Requirements

1. **Environment**
   - Built with TypeScript and bundled using Vite.
   - Managed with pnpm for dependency installation and scripts.
2. **Reliability**
   - Log errors encountered during GitHub or Docker operations without crashing.
3. **Extensibility**
   - Structure code so additional commands or integrations can be added easily.
